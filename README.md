# week1homework

## Description
This is my week one homework. The HTML and CSS code were provided, however, it was a bit messy, as there was repetitive code. I went in and cleaned up the code and added comments to make it more organized.

There was also a broken link that I fixed. (Clicking on Search Engine Optimization went nowhere)

## What did I learn

This was a good exercise on combining classes in CSS, as well as using the header/body/footer that are already basic HTML.
